# 🧠 Live Prediction Web App using Flask

This repository contains a simple and functional web application built with **Flask** that performs easy real‑time predictions. If you’re exploring ML deployment or looking for a lightweight project to contribute to, this app is a great start!

## 🚀 Live Demo
🔗 [Live App Link](#) *(Replace with your live deployed app URL)*

## 🛠 Features
- Built using Python and Flask  
- Real‑time predictions via a web interface  
- Minimal, clean UI design  
- Easily extendable for additional models or features

## 📦 Tech Stack
- Python  
- Flask  
- HTML/CSS for the frontend  
- Scikit‑learn (or any ML library you prefer)  
- Pickle or Joblib for model serialization

## 🧪 How to Run Locally

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chirayu47/flask‑prediction‑app.git
cd flask‑prediction‑app
````

Set up a virtual environment & install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```

## 🤖 Model Info

The app currently uses a simple model (e.g. Logistic Regression trained on a sample dataset). You can replace `model.pkl` with your own trained model and update input fields in `app.py` and the HTML templates.
